Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web applications in a way that makes them inclusive and usable for all people,inlcuding those with disabilities. The goal of web accessibility is to ensure that individuals with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, or other impairments can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital content efficiently.

There are some assistive devices which play a major role in providing accessibility.

1. Screen Reader : A screen reader is a software that reads out loud the content of a web page to individuals who are visually impaired. It can also interpret and communicate information about graphics, multimedia, and other elements on the page.

2. Voice recognition software: Voice recognition software enables users to navigate web pages and input text using voice commands. This technology is particularly useful for individuals with mobility impairments or those who have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse.

3. Keyboard alternatives: Keyboard alternatives such as sip-and-puff devices, head-tracking devices, and eye-tracking devices allow individuals with physical disabilities to navigate and interact with web pages without the use of a traditional keyboard or mouse.
