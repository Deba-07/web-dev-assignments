Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems Tackled by DBMS
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

File-Based Systems: Data redundancy occurs because the same data might be stored in multiple files, leading to inconsistencies when one copy is updated, but others are not.
DBMS Solution: Centralized data storage reduces redundancy and ensures consistency by updating data in one place. DBMS maintains a single data repository accessible by multiple applications, preventing duplicate data storage.
Data Integrity:

File-Based Systems: Ensuring that data adheres to certain constraints (e.g., a student's age should be a positive number) is difficult.
DBMS Solution: Enforces data integrity rules automatically through constraints, checks, and relationships between tables (e.g., foreign keys, primary keys). This ensures that all data adheres to defined rules and relationships.
Efficient Data Access:

File-Based Systems: Retrieving data requires custom scripts or programs, which can be slow and inefficient.
DBMS Solution: Provides powerful query languages like SQL to retrieve and manipulate data quickly and efficiently. This allows users to perform complex queries and data manipulations without needing custom code.
Concurrent Access and Transaction Management:

File-Based Systems: Handling multiple users accessing or modifying the same data simultaneously can lead to conflicts and data corruption.
DBMS Solution: Supports concurrent access through transaction management, ensuring that changes are applied in a controlled manner. DBMS uses mechanisms like locking, multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), and transaction isolation levels to prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity during concurrent access.
Security and Access Control:

File-Based Systems: Basic security mechanisms are limited to file permissions, which may not be sufficient for complex requirements.
DBMS Solution: Provides fine-grained access control, allowing specific permissions for different users and roles. Advanced security features like user authentication, encryption, and auditing help protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users have access to specific data.
Data Abstraction and Independence:

File-Based Systems: Changes in the structure of data (e.g., adding new fields) require modifications to existing programs.
DBMS Solution: Provides data abstraction, allowing changes in the database structure without affecting the application layer. This promotes data independence, meaning that the database schema can be modified without requiring changes to the applications that use the data.
Backup and Recovery:

File-Based Systems: Manual and error-prone processes for backing up and restoring data.
DBMS Solution: Automated tools for backup and recovery ensure data is safe and can be restored efficiently in case of failure. DBMS often includes features like point-in-time recovery, automated backups, and transaction logs to support robust data recovery strategies.
Data Management and Scalability:

File-Based Systems: Managing and organizing large volumes of files and directories becomes increasingly complex and inefficient.
DBMS Solution: Efficiently manages large volumes of data and supports scaling up to handle increased data and user load. DBMS can optimize storage and retrieval operations, making it easier to manage large datasets.
Complex Queries and Reporting:

File-Based Systems: Generating complex reports and queries requires extensive programming and custom scripts.
DBMS Solution: Allows users to perform complex queries and generate reports using SQL, providing built-in tools for data analysis and reporting. This simplifies the process of extracting insights from data.
