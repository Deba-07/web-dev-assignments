 file-based storage system is a method of storing data in a hierarchical structure of directories (or folders) and files. Each file in the system is a collection of data, such as text documents, images, or videos, stored on a physical or virtual storage medium like a hard drive or cloud storage. Users and applications access files through a file system interface, typically provided by an operating system.

Major Challenges of a File-Based Storage System
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

Redundancy: The same piece of data might be stored in multiple files, leading to unnecessary duplication.
Inconsistency: If one instance of the data is updated, others might remain outdated, leading to inconsistencies.
Limited Scalability:

As the volume of data grows, managing files and directories becomes increasingly complex.
Performance can degrade with a large number of files due to the limitations of the file system structure.
Difficulty in Data Retrieval:

Searching for specific information can be inefficient, especially if the data is scattered across many files.
There is no efficient querying mechanism to retrieve data based on specific criteria, unlike databases which support powerful query languages like SQL.
Lack of Concurrent Access Handling:

File-based systems struggle with handling simultaneous access by multiple users.
There is a risk of data corruption if multiple users try to modify the same file simultaneously without proper locking mechanisms.
Poor Data Integrity:

Ensuring data integrity and enforcing constraints is difficult.
Unlike databases, file-based systems do not have built-in mechanisms to enforce data validation and relationships between data items.
Security Issues:

File-based systems offer basic security mechanisms, such as file permissions, which may not be sufficient for complex security requirements.
Fine-grained access control and auditing features are generally less robust compared to database systems.
Backup and Recovery:

Backing up files and ensuring consistent recovery can be challenging.
Unlike database systems that often come with automated backup and recovery tools, file-based systems require more manual intervention.
